# Scratch Tech Explorations

This is a repository for sharing tech explorations related to Scratch. Different branches may or may not be related.
If you make a new experiment, try to pick a branch name that hints at what you're exploring. If you make a variant
of an existing experiment, pick a branch name that's related to the existing branch name (unless there's reason not
to).

If you're experimenting with the Scratch 3.0 editor and might want feedback, consider Scratch Lab instead.

Anything here should be treated as experimental, and may or may not be directly used in the future.

Imagine, program, share!
